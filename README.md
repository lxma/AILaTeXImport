Import Adobe Illustrator images into LaTeX

A long time ago I used [XFig](http://www.xfig.org) to make simple drawings and
include them in LaTeX documents. I particularly loved XFig's feature to export
_combined PDF and LaTeX_ files.

This package contains a .jsx Script that enables Illustrator to do the same
combined export and a .sty package to be included in the LaTeX document.
